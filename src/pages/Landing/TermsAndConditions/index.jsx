              <p>
                Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed
                upon in writing between you and MTN Podcast, the Agreements
                constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you
                and MTN Podcast and supersede any prior agreements in relation
                to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or
                oral. Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of
                the Service may be governed by additional agreements. When you
                are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you
                will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you
                may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms. Some of
                those additional terms are listed on MTN Podcast&rsquo;s
                website. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict
                between any additional terms and these MTN Podcast for
                Podcasters Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.

              </ul>

              <h5>Severability.</h5>

              <p>
                Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any
                provision of the Agreements shall be held unlawful, void, or for
                any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed
                severable from the Agreements and shall not affect the validity
                and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
              </p>

              <h5>Waiver.</h5>

              <p>
                A provision of the Agreements may be waived only by a written
                instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such
                provision. No failure or delay on the part of MTN Podcast in the
                exercise of any power or right under the Agreements shall
                operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of
                any right or power under the Agreements shall operate as a
                waiver of such right or of any other right or power. The waiver
                by MTN Podcast of a breach of any provision of the Agreements
                shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or
                subsequent breach of the Agreements.
